Essentially, it means that Yes Bank took it for granted that fees on structured loan deals will be paid and accounted for upfront on its books. As borrowers turned defaulters, the fees tied to these loan deals fell off the cracks. Gill has now vowed to shift to a safer accounting practice of amortizing fee income rather than booking these upfront.\\n\\n\\nGill’s move to mend past ways means that there will be no nasty surprises in the future. This is good news considering that investors love a clean image and loathe uncertainties.\\n\\n\\nBut there is no gain without pain and the promise of a strong and stable balance sheet comes with some sacrifices as well.

These, along with the aversion of the people of the Christian-majority state toward the BJP’s agenda to promote Hindutva and the uniform civil code, are the major issues in Nagaland.\\n\\n\\nThe direct contest in Nagaland, where money power has fuelled political corruption, is between the ‘hand’ and the ‘globe’, the election symbols of the Congress and the NDPP, respectively. Many believe the BJP-NDPP alliance has an edge because the state tends to send the ruling party candidate to the Lok Sabha. “If you don’t have support in Delhi, any state project will run into roadblocks,\" said Kathi Chishi, secretary of Toka MPCS, an organization that provides financing for rural livelihood.\\n\\n\\nThe NDPP’s candidate is Tokheho Yepthomi, the current member of parliament, who won the seat last year after Neiphiu Rio vacated it to contest the assembly elections. The Congress candidate is K.L. Chishi, former chief minister and a veteran Naga politician. Conrad Sangma’s National People’s Party has fielded a candidate, while the Naga People’s Front is backing its arch rival, the Congress, because it is against the BJP’s majoritarian Hindutva agenda and believes Congress is the party with a secular plank. An independent, M.M. Thromwa Konyak, is also in the fray. The BJP released its manifesto on Monday, restating its commitment to passing the citizenship amendment bill, which had sparked violence in the North-East. However, Yepthomi said on Friday, that after “the government is formed, the NDA partners will meet and then discuss. And what will be best for all stakeholders will be decided on that basis.\"</td>\n",
